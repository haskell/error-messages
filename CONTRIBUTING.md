# Contributing to the Message Index

Thank you for your interest in contributing! This site is a project of
the [Haskell Foundation](http://haskell.foundation), so the
[Guidelines for Respectful Communication](https://haskell.foundation/guidelines-for-respectful-communication/)
are in force.

The message index is in the directory `message-index`.

## Building GHC with Error Codes

Please follow the instructions on [building GHC with Hadrian](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/wikis/building/hadrian),
switching to the `wip/T21684` branch before compilation.
Your error messages would then contain an ID.

```
$ _build/stage1/bin/ghc --interactive
GHCi, version 9.5.20220609: https://www.haskell.org/ghc/  :? for help
ghci> 1 + "foo"

<interactive>:1:1: error: [GHC-39999]
    • No instance for (Num String) arising from the literal '1'
    • In the first argument of '(+)', namely '1'
      In the expression: 1 + "foo"
      In an equation for 'it': it = 1 + "foo"
```

## How to Document a GHC Error Code

To document a new error code, the following workflow can be convenient.
 1. Choose a code that you'd like to document, say `GHC-123`
 2. One of the following modules in the `compiler` directory of the GHC source tree will have a method called `diagnosticCode` in the instance of `Diagnostic`:
   * `GHC.Tc.Errors.Ppr`
   * `GHC.Driver.Errors.Ppr`
   * `GHC.Parser.Errors.Ppr`
   * `GHC.HsToCore.Errors.Ppr`
 3. Once the code has been found, identify the error datatype constructor that produces it.
 4. The documentation for the constructor will be in one of the following modules. Read the Haddock for an explanation of the error's meaning:
   * `GHC.Tc.Errors.Types`
   * `GHC.Driver.Errors.Types`
   * `GHC.Parser.Errors.Types`
   * `GHC.HsToCore.Errors.Types`
 5. Find the pretty-printer for the error constructor in the `X.Ppr` module. This will give an idea of how the message looks when rendered.
 6. Grep the `testsuite` directory for the error text to find examples that trigger the error.
 7. Follow the instructions below to create a page with an explanation and examples.

### Task Lists

We keep track of which errors are being worked on, and which still require documentation,
using a bunch of issues:

- [Type checker errors](https://github.com/haskell/error-messages/issues/66)
- [Driver errors](https://github.com/haskell/error-messages/issues/67)
- [Parser errors](https://github.com/haskell/error-messages/issues/68)
- [Desugarer errors](https://github.com/haskell/error-messages/issues/69)

## Contributing New Messages

The Haskell Message Index is generated from a collection of files on
disk using Hakyll. Inside the top-level of the site source, there is a
`messages` directory. Within `messages`, each subdirectory represents
a message whose name is the message code. This subdirectory contains a
file `index.md` that describes the message. Additionally,
subdirectories of the message directory may represent examples - each
example contains a file `index.md` as well as a number of Haskell
files that represent the example.

A message with ID `GHC-123` and two examples might have the following structure:

 * `/messages` - the root of all messages
   * `/messages/GHC-123` - data corresponding to message `GHC-123`
     * `/messages/GHC-123/index.md` - description and metadata for `GHC-123`
     * `/messages/GHC-123/example1/` - files related to the first example
     * `/messages/GHC-123/example1/index.md` - description and metadata for the first example
     * `/messages/GHC-123/example1/before/Main.hs` - an example file that exhibits the error
     * `/messages/GHC-123/example1/after/Main.hs` - an example file in which the error has been fixed
     * `/messages/GHC-123/example2/` - files related to the second example
     * `/messages/GHC-123/example2/index.md` - description and metadata for the second example
     * `/messages/GHC-123/example2/before/Main.hs` - an example file that exhibits the error
     * `/messages/GHC-123/example2/after/Main.hs` - an example file in which the error has been fixed

The path components `messages` and the two `index.md` files must be
named as specified here, while the other components may vary.

You can also use the `makeFolder.sh` templating script. Usage is as follows:

```bash
./makeFolder.sh <NUMERIC-ERROR-CODE> <HaskellModuleName>
```

### Message Descriptions

Message descriptions (in `index.md` in the message directory) are
written in Markdown with Pandoc-style metadata blocks. Here's an
example message description:

````markdown
---
title: Unification error
summary: Two types that should match are in conflict.
introduced: 9.4.1
severity: error
---


A unification error occurs when the type checker has received conflicting expectations about an expression's type.


## Example Text

```
Unification error: Expected type A but got type B
```
````

The fields in the metadata block should be:
 * `title` - a short title used for the page header and for links to the description, in regular sentence case (First word capitalised only, no ending `.`)
 * `summary` - a short summary used in the message index, in regular sentence case (and finished with a `.`)
 * `introduced` - the tool version in which the error code was introduced (optional)
 * `removed` - if the message was removed, the first version which no longer produces this message (optional)
 * `flag` - the flag which enables this warning (optional). Use `-Wfoo`, not `-fwarn-foo`.
 * `extension` - the language extension which has to be enabled in order for this message to be emitted (optional)

### Example Descriptions

Example descriptions are written in Markdown with Pandoc-style
metadata, just like message descriptions. They have only the `title`
field. All `.hs` files are shown in the list of files for the
example. The `index.md` file should explain how the files illustrate
the message.
