title: Illegal datatype context
---

In this example, we wish to constrain the type `a` which can parameterise the type `D` to a type that implements the `Show` and `Read` typeclasses. Whilst this can be solved currently by `-XDatatypeContexts`, this extension is deprecated.

Instead, a solution is to use a GADT to provide a constructor with the given constraints.

## Error Message
